### Review

Yusu's assignment2 codes are structured very well in a concise mannar.
In my understanding, Yusu is trying to examine whether there are differences in tripduration among gender(0=unknown,1=male,2=female). Showing mean values, the bar chart clearly describes the differences, and thus we can expect that the differences can be significant. The sample size looks large enough to test that.
In addition, I can certify that Yusu's dataset is well-prepared to test the differences above statistically.

### My suggestions
- It would be great if the file told us what the null nypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are.
- It would be helpful if the gender information, i.e. 0=unknown,1=male,2=female, was mentioned.

### Appropriate test
You can think of using 


chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.

    Write your comments, suggestions, and suggested an appropriate statistical test, motivating your test choice, in a markdown named CitibikeReview_<netID>.md. Suggest variations on the question, if you think it may be made more interesting.
