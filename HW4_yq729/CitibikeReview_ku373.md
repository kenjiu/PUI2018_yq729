### Review

Yusu's assignment2 codes are structured very well in a concise mannar.
In my understanding, Yusu is trying to examine whether there are differences in tripduration among gender(0=unknown,1=male,2=female). Showing mean values, the bar chart clearly describes the differences, and thus we can expect that the differences can be significant. The sample size looks large enough to test that. 
Initially, I was thinking to suggest to drop 0=unknown gender data because it can be not a LGBT data but a mixed gender data of LGBT data and error data. However, Yusu describes that 0=unknown gender data shows 3times+ higher means of trip duration than others, and it has a large sample size (2996). Therefore, if we see a significant difference between 0=unknow and others, it would imply the necessity of further research for what the 0=unknown gender is here.
Hereby, I can certify that Yusu's dataset is well-prepared to test the differences above statistically.

### My suggestions
- It would be great if the file told us what the null nypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are.
- It would be helpful if the gender information, i.e. 0=unknown,1=male,2=female, was mentioned in the graphs.

### Appropriate test
You can think of using Kruskal-Wallis test. 
- Non-parametric (As you show that there are huge differences in standard deviation among genders, it is safe to use non-parametric test)
- More than two independent variables
- 





chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or here, or Statistics in a Nutshell.
